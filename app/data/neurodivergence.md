`Neurodivergence` comprehends some mental conditions caused by a different neuronal development.

These mental conditions include mental disorders, learning disabilities, and other possible challenges. However, there are also strenghts that may come with the conditions, such as **better memory capacity**, **photographic memory**, the **ability to solve complex mathematical calculations**, **sharp human senses**, **hyperfocus**, and many more.

Neurodivergence is not a medical term but a way to include the people that whose brain work differently, other than just using "normal" and "abnormal". 

The `Neurotypical` term describes the people whose strengths and challenges **are not affected** by any kind of brain condition.

The term `Neurodiversity` originated from the Judy Singer, and Australian sociologist in 1998, recognizing that everyone's brain develops in a unique way.
